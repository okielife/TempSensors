# Temperature Sensor Repo

My goal with this repo is to provide everything needed for someone to construct and stand up one of the temperature sensor boxes.  
This includes the box design, hardware specs, and code.  
I will try my best to move in major version chunks together, so that if I make a design change, it is directly reflected in the code, hardware, design, etc., all at once.  
Then someone can download a single release and get everything.
