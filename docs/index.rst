Temperature Sensing
===================

This documentation covers a number of aspects of a temperature sensor project.

In summary, the temperature sensors are based on:

- a compact and simple 3D printed box (case and lid)
- a Raspberry Pico W to do all the computing
- a small TFT screen for local readout
- common DS18x20 temperature sensors
- GitHub to store the data, build the dashboard, run checks, and alert for out of range temperatures or unresponsive units
